Come one come all to the discussion of a lifetime!<br />
Ballpoint pens or fountain pens? Computer or typewriter?<br />
Whatever you use, give us a reason. Let's see what comes out.<br />

Nothing matches up to a fountain pen. Nothing.</p>
<p>I will be clear, I do not use a computer. I have never learned to type. But the smoothness and feeling of a good nib pen? There is no equal.</p>

Ok first off, who has a fountain pen? If you need to write something, there is a ballpoint pen in reach.<br />
Ballpoints are made by the millions, no premium pen matches up to that.</p>

Clearly you have never tried a fountain pen. I have used everything, from ballpoint to felt-tip and back.</p>
<p>I will not deny having a bit of an obsession with collecting those pens; but either way, a good fountain pen has no competition. I will not do my writing with anything else.</p>

@R. Schur has a point, I have never gotten to try an actual fountain pen, they are not that easy to come by. Ballpoint pens do have an easy and cheap convenience.</p>
<p>Then again, I usually type on a computer, so what do I know.</p>

Computers always feel over-facilitating. I can usually tell when someone is using a word processor.</p>
<p>People seem to add more random adjectives when they type, they can write words faster so they use more of them, without thinking if those words are actually necessary.</p>
<p>Using a fine pen slows you down just enough to think through your words. Keeps you from getting too description crazy.</p>

It seems to me that people have started neglecting their handwriting skills. Schools in the US put a lot less stress on writing then they used to.</p>
<p>Lots of other places have kept up the traditions. France still holds proper respect for the written word. Not just printing out all the copies they ever need.</p>

Now listen here: digital notes do have their benefits.<br />
Digitizing patient records has sped up a lot of processes here. The least of which is faster writing.</p>
<p>Sharing digital copies takes no effort, and editing can go back just as fast. Handwritten papers take time to copy and with pens, it is not a breeze to edit. Even travel time and sorting makes a huge difference here.</p>

I will admit that typing has its benefits, (I am practicing right now) but handwriting is so much more pleasant.</p>
<p>A fountain pen is so much smoother and direct. As an action, typing does not feel as natural. Even if you need to eventually type it out, putting a first draft in pen makes for a much nicer writing experience. Throwing in a smooth and high quality pen is just common sense at that point. Quality writing needs quality tools.</p>

Why use an expensive French fountain pen, when you can use that Chinese pen you found on the floor!!!</p>
<p>A ballpoint pen does not leak or run out of ink easily, and it writes with ease and comfort. I don't see why you need anything else.
We went through many years of innovation and bad pens to get them, don't screw it up.</p>

That may be the case in the US, but France has no such shortage.</p>
<p>Actually I see no reason for fountain pens to be as rare as you seem to find them.<br>
There are even still many people who would call a letter written by ballpoint rude. Such pens are not as universal as you think.</p>
