                    Originally built as part of <i>Temple of Pele</i>,
                    Skyrmion has been converted into a full 2d game engine based on SFML.<br>
                    It has a focus on tilemaps and grids, but also supports dynamic lighting,
                    remappable controls, and more.<br>
                    Details and some documentation in the readme.

                    This is a WIP Solitaire card game engine with themes and joystick controls.<br>
                    It uses a custom programming language based on Lisp to allow adding new card games on runtime. Progress has been made towards allowing multiplayer games and auto-solving tips.

                    Built as a group project in college, this is a simple 2d puzzle dungeon game.<br>
                    It has also become a test bed for new features in the Skyrmion engine.

                    One of my many solo game jams, a short top down coop game.<br>
                    This is where I made a dynamic lighting engine for Skyrmion.

                    The first game jam I did with a team, the first side-scrolling game using Skyrmion.<br>
                    Required creating a custom physics engine and improving large world mapping.
