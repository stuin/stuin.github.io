                <p style="max-width:700px;">
                    An open source project I have contributed to occasionally with snippets in many programming languages.<br>
                    I have also written a few articles explaining programs for the website, such as <a class="norm" href="https://sampleprograms.io/projects/hello-world/befunge/">Hello World in Befunge</a>.

                    Intended as the start of a larger project,
                    ended up as just a random galaxy generator.

                <p style="max-width:700px;">
                    I also have a bunch of terminal games,
                    I wanted a challenge so I made text Minesweeper and Chess.
                    All made for linux in kotlin.
