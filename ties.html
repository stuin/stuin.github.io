				This list is of all the tie knots I use, (in progress)
				described as clearly and specifically as possible.
				At the moment it will only be text, with pictures to come soon.
				There will be a guide on general technique and how to follow these special instructions.

		</div>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Half Windsor <input type="submit" value="Show" onclick="show('half_windsor', this);"/></h3> 
				<div class="flex-container" id="half_windsor">
					<div>
						<p style="max-width:450px;">
							One of the most simple and adaptable knots commonly known.
							Easy to tie and remember, and usable in almost any shirt tie combination.
							For an easy trick: "Around and down, then around and up, and tuck in."
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<ol>
							<li>Tie with large end</li>
							<li>Wrap around front to start-side</li>
							<li>Through neck from start-side to back</li>
							<li>Wrap around front once to off-side</li>
							<li>Through neck from back</li>
							<li>Tuck through front layer</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Four in hand <input type="submit" value="Show" onclick="show('four_hand', this);"/></h3>
				<div class="flex-container" id="four_hand">
					<div>
						<p style="max-width:450px;">
							This is the quickest knot to tie, but can be much too small for certain combinations.
							Wear this only with a thin tie and collar.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<ol>
							<li>Tie with large end</li>
							<li>Wrap around front once and to off-side</li>
							<li>Through neck from back</li>
							<li>Tuck through front layer</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Full Windsor <input type="submit" value="Show" onclick="show('full_windsor', this);"/></h3> 
				<div class="flex-container" id="full_windsor">
					<div>
						<p style="max-width:450px;">
							The original complete version of the popular windsor.
							Probably invented by the father of the famous Duke of Windsor.
							Larger than the half windsor, but not too large.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<ol>
							<li>Tie with large end</li>
							<li>Wrap around front to start-side</li>
							<li>Through neck from start-side to back</li>
							<li>Wrap around front once to off-side</li>
							<li>Through neck from back</li>
							<li>Tuck through front layer</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Pratt (Shelby) <input type="submit" value="Show" onclick="show('pratt', this);"/></h3>
				<div class="flex-container" id="pratt">
					<div>
						<p style="max-width:450px;">
							Very similer to the half windsor, this is lesser known now due to its backwards state,
							but is still quite a simple and balenced knot. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<ol>
							<li>Tie with large end reversed</li>
							<li>Wrap around back to start-side</li>
							<li>Through neck from back to start-side</li>
							<li>Wrap around back once to start-side</li>
							<li>Through neck from back</li>
							<li>Tuck through front layer</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Atlantic <input type="submit" value="Show" onclick="show('atlantic', this);"/></h3>
				<div class="flex-container" id="atlantic">
					<div>
						<p style="max-width:450px;">
							A much more fancy looking knot, this is similer to a backwards Pratt,
							but is easier to tie than it looks.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<ol>
							<li>Tie with small end</li>
							<li>Wrap around front to back</li>
							<li>Through neck from back to start-side</li>
							<li>Wrap around back to off-side</li>
							<li>Through neck from off-side to back</li>
							<li>Tuck through back layer</li>
						</ol>
