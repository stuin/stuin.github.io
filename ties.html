				This list is of all the tie knots I use, (in progress)
				described as clearly and specifically as possible.
				At the moment it will only be text, with pictures to come soon.
				There will be a guide on general technique and how to follow these special instructions.
				This list is in no specific order, least of all difficulty.

		<button class="accordion">Half Windsor</button>
		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">
					One of the most simple and adaptable knots commonly known.
					Easy to tie and remember, and usable in almost any shirt tie combination.
					For an easy trick: "Around and down, then around and up, and tuck in."
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-item">
				<ol>
					<li>Tie with large end</li>
					<li>Wrap around front to start-side</li>
					<li>Through neck from start-side to back</li>
					<li>Wrap around front once to off-side</li>
					<li>Through neck from back</li>
					<li>Tuck through front layer</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

		<button class="accordion">Four in Hand</button>
		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">
					This is the quickest knot to tie, but can be much too small for certain combinations.
					Wear this only with a thin tie and collar.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-item">
				<ol>
					<li>Tie with large end</li>
					<li>Wrap around front once and to off-side</li>

		<button class="accordion">Full Windsor</button>
		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">
					The original complete version of the popular windsor.
					Probably invented by the father of the famous Duke of Windsor.
					Larger than the half windsor, but not too large.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-item">
				<ol>
					<li>Tie with large end</li>

		<button class="accordion">Pratt (Shelby)</button>
		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">
					Very similer to the half windsor, but a bit smaller. 
					Makes a very straight triangle.
					This knot is lesser known now due to its backwards state,
					but is still quite a simple and balanced knot. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-item">
				<ol>
					<li>Tie with large end reversed</li>
					<li>Wrap around back to start-side</li>

		<button class="accordion">Prince Albert</button>
		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">
					Though unfortunately named, 
					this knot creates a strong set of layers.
					Very very simple,
					best to use a finger in the loop to keep it straight.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-item">
				<ol>
					<li>Tie with large end</li>
					<li>Wrap around front to twice and to off-side loosely</li>

		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">

				<ol>
					<li>Tie with large end</li>

			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">
					One of the most famous complicated knots, 
					it was the knot to introduce me to the art.
					With an extreme set of layers,
					it is a tie used only to show off.

			</div>
			<div class="flex-item">
				<ol>
					<li>Tie with small end</li>
					<li>Wrap around front to start-side</li>

			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">

			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">

		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">

		<button class="accordion">Vortex</button>
		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">
					One of two knots I designed myself, based off of the Atantic. 
					It has a similer appearance to the Elderedge,

		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">
					A difficult knot made to appear like the Atlantic, 
					but more straight and with another layer.
					Much more formal and neat than the original.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-item">
				<ol>
					<li>Tie with small end</li>

		<div class="flex-container" style="background-color: #B37C00;">
			<div class="flex-item">
				<p style="max-width:450px;">
					A small improvement on the Atlantic, 
					giving a satisfying cape behind the knot.
					Leave the top of the knot loose to give it
					a smooth and unique appearance.

			<div class="flex-item">
				<ol>
					<li>Tie with small end</li>
					<li>Wrap around front to back twice tightly</li>
