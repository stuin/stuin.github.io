                <p style="max-width:700px;">
                    My first minecraft computer, built using copper bulbs as an 8-bit Brainfuck interpreter.<br>
                    Slow/inconsistent clock speed and a limited number of instructions mean it is barely more than a proof of concept.

                <h3>WIP: Modular/Distributed Instructions Copper Bulb Computer</h3>
                <p style="max-width:700px;">
                    Using just a few ideas from the first, this is a much larger and faster computer with more instructions, longer programs, and a unique distributed register system; where each instruction is it's own circuit with it's own copy of the 2 main 8-bit registers.<br>
                    Each circuit can then precalculate it's output, and push it to the register lines when called to toggle the correct bits.<br>
                    This is also hooked up to a 8x8 multi-color screen and a proper input system.<br>
                    The computer currently runs at 1.25hz and can complete a few simple programs.

                <p style="max-width:700px;">
                    A Redstone / Command Block TARDIS, it has gone through many iterations over the years.
                    It now uses a small chat based control system so that the console can be easily changed.
                    Once a control room is registered one can walk in and out of any console room door.
                    The outside materializes with a unique sequence and can be edited easily.

                <p style="max-width:700px;">
                    A large magic mod made with a group for a modjam. Allows collecting tears from Crying Obsidian and using them to power magical runes and devices.<br>
                    I certainly hope to continue it but it is a large project with a huge amount of work remaining, and I will not settle for a small incremental update after all this time.

                    A much smaller mod to easily convert energy using smelting mechanics.
                    It uses simple smelting to convert energy evenly between any mod.
