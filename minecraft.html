                <p style="max-width:500px;">
                    A while ago I made a Minecraft mod to easily convert energy using smelting mechanics.
                    It uses simple smelting to convert energy evenly between any mod.

					Recently I have been making youtube videos about some of my cooler Minecraft projects.
					Mostly redstone right now but other stuff should be coming soon.

                <h3>The TARDIS</h3>
                <p style="max-width:500px;">
                    For years I have also been working on a Redstone / Command Block TARDIS.
                    It now uses a small chat based control system so that the console can be easily changed.
                    Once a control room is registered one can walk in and out of any console room door.
                    The outside materializes with a unique sequence and can be edited easily.
                    There is a video of it on my channel.
