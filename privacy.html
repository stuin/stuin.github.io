        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Neither the app known as Ten Seconds to Symmetry, nor any part of this website, collects data. There is nothing collected or communicated by either of these applications, and no place it could be stored.
        </p>
        <p>
           If in the future there is any such addition to one of these systems, it will be clearly indicated, completely optional and any purpose will be throughly explained, relating only to the inner workings of the project itself. All users of the system will be notified of the change.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ten Seconds To Symmetry collects no private data, stores only its high score and explicit user settings, and has no capability to read or write information outside of its own application.
